Maybe this meeting will be discussion about Ruby 2.4 based on tickets.
Please add your favorite ticket numbers you want to ask to discuss.

* NOTE
  * Dev meeting *IS NOT* a decision making place. All decisions should be done at the bug tracker.
  * Dev meeting is a place we can ask Matz, nobu, nurse and other developers directly. Matz is very busy person, so we can ask him directly on this opportunity. If you can not attend there, then other attendees can ask instead you (if attendees can understand your issue).
  * We will write a log about discussion on a file or each tickets in English.
  * All of activities are best-effort (please remind that most of us are volunteer developers).
  * The date, time and place is when/where we can reserve Matz's time.

# Agenda

* NOTE: Write at least "ticket number/title/link" and your name. Explain details on the ticket. If you can not attend meeting, short summary are welcome because we can understand easily (long discussion is difficult to read, especially in non-native languages). Your motivation is also welcome.

(discussing about current behavior of related methods)

- matz: does it make sense?
- (others): yes

# \[Feature [#10617](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/10617&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086778189557&usg=AOvVaw3n9pUWMsFxA5DDKNUZfPip)\] Change multiple assignment in conditional from parse error to warning (shyouhei)

- ko1: counter proposal. returning array can affect performance. how about to make mltiple assignment as a void expression?

- example: [http://www.atdot.net/~ko1/diary/201502.html#d16](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.atdot.net/~ko1/diary/201502.html%23d16&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086778190126&usg=AOvVaw19YZbfs8LPRC7b-VT8S2vA)

- naruse: I doubt the reporter’s true working code is
    a, b = some\_method\_returning\_array\_or\_nil
    if a || b
    \# method returned an array (possibly empty)
    else
     # method returned nil.
    end

- Understood and +1 for this feature, but maybe naming is a problem
- We also have to wait a Matz.

# How we use twitter account for announcement (sorah)

- few months ago, we talked about having a twitter account for announcement. after a while, @mrkn signed an account up and delegated to @sorah.
- How we use this account? @sorah is thinking to post www.ruby-lang.org feeds. One consideration is current w.r-l.o feed contains community news. The account should contain or shouldn’t? (= only release informations)

- Conclusion: only for release notes.

- note that @sorah is also a w.r-l.o editorial.
- next action: @sorah will continue setting up.
