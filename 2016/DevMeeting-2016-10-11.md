# DevMeeting-2016-10-11

Date: 2016/10/11 (Tue)
Time: 14:00- 18:00 (JST)
Place: SFDC Japan, Tokyo
connpass: http://ruby.connpass.com/event/39930/

Attendees/参加者: duerst (Martin Dürst), shyouhei, hsbt, mrkn
Language: mostly Japanese (sorry for non native Japanese speakers)

Please add your favorite ticket numbers you want to ask to discuss.

* NOTE
  * Dev meeting *IS NOT* a decision making place. All decisions should be done at the bug tracker.
  * Dev meeting is a place we can ask Matz, nobu, nurse and other developers directly. Matz is a very busy person.  Take this opportunity to ask him. If you can not attend, other attendees can ask instead of you (if attendees can understand your issue).
  * We will write a log about discussion to a file or to each ticket in English.
  * All activities are best-effort (keep in mind that most of us are volunteer developers).
  * The date, time and place is scheduled according to when/where we can reserve Matz's time.

# Agenda

* NOTE: Write at least "ticket number/title/link" and your name (see example below). Explain details on the ticket. If you cannot attend the meeting, we appreciate a short summary because we can understand it more easily (long discussion is difficult to read, especially in a non-native language). Your motivation is also welcome.

## About 2.4 timeframe

## (From RubyKaigi admin) for Keynote speakers

* Please send us keynote speaker's Shinkansen receipt (shyouhei)

# Agenda

- next meeting?

- Nov. 3-4 RWC
- Nov. 5-6 (camp?)@ Shimane
- Nov. 10-12 RubyConf
- conclusion: next meeing will be some point at later half of November.

- dev-camp?

- hotel, transport, and arrangement are OK (by ruby-assn)
- seems enough people are willing to attend.

- st report (ko1)

- ko1 benchmarked 3 (Vladimir’s, FunnyFalcon’s, current one) implementations

- against kaminari-pagenated rails scaffold
- using ab

- he found most time are consumed in looking up of small tables (size <= 64).
- for such small tables, it seems everything are on cache, algorithm difference was negilible.
- lets merge (any one of them) at the camp.

## About 2.4 timeframe

- [https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-trunk/wiki/ReleaseEngineering24](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-trunk/wiki/ReleaseEngineering24&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086930351083&usg=AOvVaw2L-Zg8RwYhuncyL23DuTct)

- naruse: I’ll do this on camp.

- \[Feature [#12695](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12695&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086930352946&usg=AOvVaw2P3EnZbXbqOoZZfJ1MjPXZ)\] File.expand\_path should resolve ~/ using /etc/passwd when HOME is not set (shyouhei) conclusion?

- nobu: it will be merged when rubygems side is OK.
- hsbt: carefully watching rubygems’ progress.

- \[Feature [#6647](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/6647&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086930353822&usg=AOvVaw2Yzrz03mx8N-9BeUdhqk1s)\] Exceptions raised in threads should be logged (shyouhei) Look at [\[ruby-core:77259\]](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/77259&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086930354071&usg=AOvVaw2-hrivnRy7J0n0ktxeJVUh)

- akr: the proposal can be okay, but we currently do not implemnt thread GC mode.

- \[Feature [#12744](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12744&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086930354673&usg=AOvVaw2XHZ5ssMRX1s5sXBf7Cud8)\] Add str.reverse\_each\_char and str.reverse\_chars (shyouhei) conclusion?

- naruse: I agree this makes things faster a bit, but will it really be needed?
- Martin: array allocation is avoided in the patch, but each\_char generates lots of strings anyways.

- \[Bug [#11195](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11195&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086930355169&usg=AOvVaw1OsPxSKKdvSr_piG0Qe-wp)\] Add "no\_proxy" parameter to Net::HTTP.new (shyouhei) Roman Bigler volunteers.

- mrkn: I suggest Math::TWOPI
- akr: C has PI\_2, but this means π/2
- wating for matz (or time?)

- \[Bug [#12674](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12674&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086930360527&usg=AOvVaw1hqJIxnP2drHmu-0egJeEq)\] io/wait: not handling the case when the socket is closed before doing wait\_readable/writable with timeout (shyouhei) might be a design issue?

Stepping into inspect in debugger locks it up with 100% CPU. (shyouhei)

- akr: I have a conception of ritcher inspection framework that passes-around contexts, but have not implemented yet.

- \[Bug [#10222](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/10222&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086930361713&usg=AOvVaw2JXdIk6kGmDD6h_6YCwaae)\] require\_relative and require should be compatible with each other (shyouhei)

- akr: require\_relative expands real path, while require doesn’t.
- naruse: if we expand realpath on require, we need disk access every time we call require (even when the library is already loaded).
- naruse: what about adding both real path and expanded path to $LOADED\_FEATURES at once for require?
- shyouhei: I think for this shown use case b.rb shall not be called twice.

- \[Bug [#12705](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12705&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086930362193&usg=AOvVaw356hZ9qUN_ZfSmkDZkoOzY)\] yielding args to a lambda uses block/proc rather than lambda/method semantics (shyouhei)

- akr: I think it’s a bug.  They should be consistent.
- akr: someone broke here at 2.2.
- ko1: maybe me.

- \[Bug [#4537](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/4537&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086930362603&usg=AOvVaw3YgfR6n5vfOGD7EhwMaEFE)\] Incorrectly creating private method via attr\_accessor (shyouhei) cf. \[Bug [#9005](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/9005&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086930362767&usg=AOvVaw0QL7nL3TIXcjdruCp8qCKO)\]

- akr: it seems there are needs of other conversion methods than to\_i or Integer
- nobu: they just want to detect validity, not exceptions.
- Martin: what about Integer?()
- Martin: but Upcase?() is a new concept.
- waiting for matz.

- \[Feature [#12745](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12745&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086930364089&usg=AOvVaw1tzeHHmpZSPRqTGKwFrijG)\] String#(g)sub(!) should pass a MatchData to the block, not a String (shyouhei)

- akr: naming matters.
- shyouhei: is that we need a new method name?  What about changing gsub behaviour?
- akr: it breaks compatibility.
- akira: what about passing extra second argument to the block, which happen to be a copy of $~
- akr: that is possible.
- nobu: what about defineing MatchData#to\_str ?
- shyouhei: it might be possible to extend the passed string to define method that returns $~.
- akr: adding a new method is the most clean way if we can find good method name.

- \[Feature [#12747](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12747&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086930364862&usg=AOvVaw143Gbv7OihK3VYxZ5ZfsCF)\] Add TracePoint#callee\_id (shyouhei)

- akr: I can’t read the output.
- mrkn: yes.  I’ll fix this.  But it’s not that simple.

- \[Feature #12005\] define rb\_cFixnum and rb\_Bignum again? (akr)

- dependency hell

- situation: we “tried” to delete them.  Main difficulty is “gem ‘json’, ‘~> 1.8.0’”
- hsbt: I pushed this change (remove JSON’s version) to Rails 4

- C-level constants: rb\_cFixnum and rb\_cBignum

- akr: resurrection of these constants does \_not\_ solve the issue.

- warnigs for Ruby-level constants: Fixnum and Bignum

- nobu: lets see RC1’s response.

- \[Bug [#12828](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12828&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086930366756&usg=AOvVaw1c5m8QmSFb81a83FEQB4AO)\] Check whether macro RUBY is okay for protecting ruby-specific onigumo extensions (duerst)

- nobu: RUBY is already defined at defines.h
- naruse: doesn’t anyone want to use vanilla onigumo someday?
- akr: is that possible?  Not that easy than it sounds.

## From non-attendees

Write your name and your interest (what do you want to ask and to whom?) please.

- \[Feature [#12760](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12760&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086930367484&usg=AOvVaw2YVQ5SLKojV8JdEyR088Zm)\] Optional block argument for itself (Victor Shepelev)

- “itself” doesn’t sound right
- nobu: if itself takes block it should behave like tap.
