# DevMeeting-2016-06-13

Date: 2016/06/13 (Mon)
Time: 14:00- 18:00 (JST)
Place: Tokyo, Japan

Attendees: Assuming active developers. Sign up is required. Please ask ko1 for details. If you want to attend remotely, also please ask ko1.
Language: mostly Japanese (sorry for non native Japanese speakers)

Maybe in this meeting we discuss about Ruby 2.4, based on tickets.
Please add your favorite ticket numbers you want to ask to discuss.

* NOTE
  * Dev meeting *IS NOT* a decision making place. All decisions should be done at the bug tracker.
  * Dev meeting is a place we can ask Matz, nobu, nurse and other developers directly. Matz is a very busy person.  Take this opportunity to ask him. If you can not attend, other attendees can ask instead you (if attendees can understand your issue).
  * We will write a log about discussion on a file or each tickets in English.
  * All activities are best-effort (keep in mind that most of us are volunteer developers).
  * The date, time and place is scheduled according to when/where we can reserve Matz's time.

# Agenda

* NOTE: Write at least "ticket number/title/link" and your name (see example below). Explain details on the ticket. If you can not attend meeting, short summary are welcome because we can understand easily (long discussion is difficult to read, especially in non-native languages). Your motivation is also welcome.

# The meeting for Preview 1.

Release management of 2.4: When release 2.4 preview1?

- Motivation: Test recent big changes

- Integer
- OpenSSL
- String#upcase/downcase/… now works for Unicode

- Motivation: to release before RedDotRubyConf

This release doesn’t prevent further big changes for Ruby 2.4.

(This release is different from an usual preview1 (even more ‘previewy’))

# \[Misc [#12283](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12283&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086826655925&usg=AOvVaw1V_E-bm4yWtswMJZVEpfua)\] Obsolete ChangeLog and commit message in Git-style (shyouhei) situation and progress?

Any progress? → Nothing

Naruse-san or Nakada-san will do.

Q: How should I do when I miss the reference and so on.

A: Use empty commit.

# How to handle security issues (shugo)

- Pros./Cons. about using GitHub, Slack, HackerOne and etc.
- Aaron proposed [HackerOne](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hackerone.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086826656926&usg=AOvVaw2y0HYccn4wVgP7bYHoMjod) which is a specialized Web site to discuss security issues. In particular, it doesn’t include actual contents in email notifications, …, and also has a system for bounties.
- We can’t stop Mail address.
- Current issue

- We need to decrypt security issue and encrypt to report.
- GitHub notifications must be disabled because they contain sensitive information.

- Try this service.
- Should we decide whether reports are eligible for bounty?

# \[Feature [#12333](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12333&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086826657701&usg=AOvVaw1FvhwrnKWfgcUzKqYPJjgs)\] String#concat, Array#concat, String#prepend to take multiple arguments (shyouhei)

matz: acceptable

nobu: this patch requires some tests, and fixes.

- ar = \[1\]; ar.concat(ar, ar) #=> \[1,1,1\]? or \[1,1,1,1\]?

- mrkn: we can make \[1, 1, 1, 1\] with a.concat(ar).concat(ar)
- Matz: Maybe programer may get \[1, 1, 1\]. So use it.

- see https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby/wiki/DeveloperHowto

# \[Feature #12247\] accept multiple arguments at Array#delete

What’s happen?

ary = \[:a, :b, :c, :d, :e\]

ary.delete(:a, :f, :c) #=> ???

\# (1) \[:a, :c\]

\# (2) \[:a, nil, :c\]

- ko1: who requires return value (array)?
- sora\_h: With (2), we can use a return value with multiple assignment

- x, y, z = ary.delete(:a, :f, :c)
- Especially for Hash#delete (this is out of scope, but we should consier consistency)

# \[Bug [#12295](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12295&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086826660239&usg=AOvVaw0hwar7O_qyBzkPdBFgwA9x)\] Ripper not emitting on\_parse\_error for global variable name syntax errors (shyouhei) is this the right design?

Assigned to Minero Aoki.

- matz approved to add commit permission to Tadashi-san.
- mrkn will reivew the proposed patch

# \[Feature [#12281](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12281&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086826661465&usg=AOvVaw2dEZ2PXv_iAmh6mgKgRRd5)\] Allow lexically scoped use of refinements with using {} block syntax (shyouhei)

Assigned to shugo.

# \[Feature #12086\] using: option for instance\_eval etc.

Motivation is replace self and using context.

“Can we make it convinient?”

Matz will comment it.

# \[Feature [#12447](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12447&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086826662909&usg=AOvVaw2ZpI0-lpWz4qDN0qZ74i3a)\] Integer#digits for extracting digits of place-value notation in any base (mrkn)

- Q. Endian? #=> Little endian
- Q. how about negative integers? #=> Math::DomainError
- Q. how about 0? #=> \[0\] or \[\] #=> \[0\]

matz: i’m not sure how it is convinience. but ok.

# \[Feature [#12299](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12299&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086826664297&usg=AOvVaw313x6w3Lpw3IeQbvNFuWT4)\] Add Warning module for customized warning handling (jeremyevans)

naruse: it sounds useful with Gem.loaded\_specs\[ gem\_name \].full\_gem\_path.

matz: ok (except naming).

# Supported Platforms (duerst)

h[ttps://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-trunk/wiki/SupportedPlatforms](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-trunk/wiki/SupportedPlatforms&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086826666672&usg=AOvVaw3V0qvcsp0fuYrQ2ZFHMHks) says it’s for Ruby 1.9; needs some updating.

# \[Feature [#12460](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12460&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086826667695&usg=AOvVaw2o73k2frUa5OTnCGcJT7Oa)\] Make Unicode Version directly available in Ruby (duerst)

Approved; name as proposed by Nobu: RbConfig::CONFIG\['UNICODE\_VERSION'\]; implementation: Nobu or Martin.

# Non-ASCII in rdoc comments in C source (duerst)

See [https://github.com/rdoc/rdoc/issues/409](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/rdoc/rdoc/issues/409&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086826669415&usg=AOvVaw2EhluWwZ8TBFyBzz6e43aB). Intent is understandable. May work by just using &#(x)... HTML/XML convention; needs to be checked further.

# \[Bug [#12427](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12427&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686086826670082&usg=AOvVaw1Vu8MUVbVbsHHXmO7xY7ib)\] the way that extension libraries know if Integer is integrated (nobu)

Nobu prepared a patch to show warning for rb\_cFixnum and rb\_cBignum, so developers can recognize this change. However, there are risks to compile broken code (assume passed parameters are Fixnum, but passed BIgnums. In this case, it is difficult to check Fixnum asusmed methods because Bignum may be rare to use, in general).

We can recognize this change with removing rb\_cFixnum and rb\_cBignum, but there are several gems causing compile errors.

→ try to remove rb\_cFixnum, rb\_cBignum at Ruby 2.4  preview 1 to check people’s responses
