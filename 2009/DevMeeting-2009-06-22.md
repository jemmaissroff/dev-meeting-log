== New/Changed Features
Some libraries were improved/reimplemented.
* Socket
* Time
* pipe, pty and open3

see http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/trunk/NEWS for more detail.

=== TODO
Some features need more discussions. We must decide detail of the
features by 25 Sep.
* Enumerable#gather
  * [ruby-dev:38392]
* Time#+ can accept a String as a rhs.
  * Do we need #to_rational in addition to #to_r ?
  * [ruby-core:23729]
  * assigned to akr and matz.
* Should the encoding for ENV be the locale encoding?
  * assigned to naruse.
* we need an option for IO methods which makes the methods skip BOMs.
  * [ruby-dev:37075]
  * assigned to naruse.
* Should we increase the version of Marshal format?
  * for "\u"
  * [ruby-dev:36750]
  * assigned to shyouhei and matz.

=== If possible
I hope to include the following features into the 1.9.2. But they might
take too many time for deciding their specs and implementing them.
* SQLite as a standard library
  * [ruby-dev:38463]
  * assigned to naruse
* improvement of YARV opcode set.
  * assigned to ko1.
* debugger support
  * assigned to ko1
* profiler support
  * assigned to ko1
* dtrace support on FreeBSD, OpenSolaris and OSX.
  * assigned to yugui and ko1.

The features will be included in the 1.9.2 if they will be in time for
the feature freeze.
