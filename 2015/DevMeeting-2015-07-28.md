* NOTE
  * Dev meeting *IS NOT* a decision making place. All decisions should be done at the bug tracker.
  * Dev meeting is a place we can ask Matz, nobu, nurse and other developers directly. Matz is very busy person, so we can ask him directly on this opportunity. If you can not attend there, then other attendees can ask instead you (if attendees can understand your issue).
  * We will write a log about discussion on a file or each tickets in English.
  * All of activities are best-effort (please remind that most of us are volunteer developers).
  * The date, time and place is when/where we can reserve Matz's time.

# Agenda

* NOTE: Write at least "ticket number/title/link" and your name. Explain details on the ticket. If you can not attend meeting, short summary are welcome because we can understand easily (long discussion is difficult to read, especially in non-native languages). Your motivation is also welcome.

Introducing IDL will

 GOOD: improve performance

 BAD: increase required knowledeg to hack Ruby

Introducing the primitve “C.foo(x, y)” calling C function “foo” with two VALUEs “x and y” seems good primitive only in prelude.rb. Now, it is only for prelude.rb, not for all C-extensions.

akr pointed out that it will introduce incompatibility compare with C implemented function and Ruby with C function because therea are interrupt timing in Ruby. For example,

 class IO

 def IO.open(..., &b)

 fd = C.sysopen(...)

 f = IO.new(fd)

 …

this code can leak \`fd’ if some exception is occur before making IO object (IO object will free fd). In this case, we need to make C functions to make IO objects.

Also, additional TracePoint will be introduced.
