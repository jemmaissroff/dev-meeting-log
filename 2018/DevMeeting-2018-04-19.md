# DevMeeting-2018-04-19

# DevelopersMeeting20180419Japan

Date: 2018/04/19 (Thu)
Time: 14:00-18:00 (JST)
Place: Speee, Inc.
Sign-up: https://ruby.connpass.com/event/82991/
Attendees:
Regrets: (add your name here if you often attend, but can't attend this time)
Language: mostly Japanese (sorry for non native Japanese speakers)

Please add your favorite ticket numbers you want to ask to discuss.  If you have no right to edit this page, add a comment to the ticket that you want to ask to discuss.

* NOTE
  * Dev meeting *IS NOT* a decision making place. All decisions should be done at the bug tracker.
  * Dev meeting is a place we can ask Matz, nobu, nurse and other developers directly. Matz is a very busy person.  Take this opportunity to ask him. If you can not attend, other attendees can ask instead of you (if attendees can understand your issue).
  * We will write a log about discussion to a file or to each ticket in English.
  * All activities are best-effort (keep in mind that most of us are volunteer developers).
  * The date, time and place is scheduled according to when/where we can reserve Matz's time.

# Agenda

* NOTE: Write at least "ticket number/title/link" and your name (see example below). Explain details on the ticket. If you cannot attend the meeting, we appreciate a short summary because we can understand it more easily (long discussion is difficult to read, especially in a non-native language). Your motivation is also welcome.

### From attendees

\[Bug [#14345](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14345&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087582532185&usg=AOvVaw3IWZKfF7_hWm-nwgtUzLTY)\] http\_proxy setting should respect both parent domain and subdomain (hsbt)

\[Feature [#14559](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14559&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087582532577&usg=AOvVaw29ARuGoj689fSVf2Qv97VX)\] ENV.slice (hsbt)

- Matz: OK.

\[Feature [#14643](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14643&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087582533063&usg=AOvVaw0dcV1X2EpkkLPz8iXjniUL)\] Remove problematic separator '\\0' of Dir.glob and Dir.\[\] (usa)

- Usa: we can pass arrays to the pattern.  No need to use \\0.
- Matz: makes sense.

\[Feature [#14111](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14111&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087582533687&usg=AOvVaw3-M7sQsq-tX6nPxfPxNs6x)\] ArgumentErrorが発生した時メソッドのプロトタイプをメッセージに含む (nobu)

- nobu : seems OK to me.
- Mame: is the “prototype” the actual string in the source code, or reconstructed?
- nobu : reconstructed.
- Matz: so it doesn’t show C source code.
- Matz: OK so far.
- Matz: do we call this info “prototype”?
- Naruse: declaration?
- Mrkn: signature?
- Akr: I prefer “arguments”
- Nobu: would like to review the patch again.
- Ko1: what to show for singleton methods? Might be difficult.

\[Bug [#14688](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14688&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087582534910&usg=AOvVaw2Rta1gG7nfEHqxQmIRNJh3)\] Net::HTTPResponse#value raises "Net::HTTPServerException" in 4xx response (usa)

\[Feature [#14683](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14683&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087582535339&usg=AOvVaw19eQM71AjD0zeJgJPTYSK1)\] IRB with Ripper (aycabta)

- Ask keiju to look at it.
- Akr: do the OP want to maintain this?  Or make it a gem to delete from the repo?

\[Feature [#14694](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14694&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087582535827&usg=AOvVaw3AFwkFldUCAVrDfvfRhpIX)\] TracePoint#parameters (mame)

- Matz: I see no problem?
- Ko1: TracePoint#parameters sounds like it expects the parameter values, not the names.

\[Feature [#14624](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14624&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087582536343&usg=AOvVaw3VJYGH4HbLgombVfk0xXky)\] #{nil} allocates a fresh empty string each time (nobu)

- Matz: sounds like an implementation detail.
- Ko1: it’s too large a patch to implement this as a new VM instruction.
- Naruse: when I tested opt\_to\_s with @k0kubun the speedup was marginal/not that much.

\[Feature [#6670](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/6670&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087582536919&usg=AOvVaw2IAX5fob7lHbyXTGjER27Y)\] str.chars.last should be possible (mame)

- Mame: I’d like to give up deprecation of this block-giving behaviour.
- Matz: OK.

\[Feature [#12912](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12912&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087582537436&usg=AOvVaw0n54gDht5IREMiCynjPwTW)\] An endless range (1..) (mame)

- Mame: I’d like to consult matz.
- Matz: I honestly feel there should be a fluent way to do 0..Float::INFINITY.
- Ko1: does this feature conflict with the step concept?
- Mrkn: seems not.
- Akr: when this is done, needs of step should reduce very much.
- Matz: accepted.

\[Feature [#14352](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14352&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087582538295&usg=AOvVaw3-yqykiIw3ke_ARM6v5zZU)\] Array#pack("M") Quoted-printable (matz)

- Naruse: I’ll take care.  Let me make this a doc issue.

\[Feature #14594\] Rethink yield\_self's name (matz)

- Matz: I can live with #then.

\[Feature [#14697](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14697&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087582538990&usg=AOvVaw06Lv7bq1IFY7Q388WdmB8V)\] Introducing Range#% as an alias to Range#step (mrkn)

- Matz: I have no objection.
- Mrkn: Numo’s Range#% is here [https://github.com/ruby-numo/numo-narray/blob/master/ext/numo/narray/step.c#L464](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/ruby-numo/numo-narray/blob/master/ext/numo/narray/step.c%23L464&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087582539415&usg=AOvVaw2Hpfbz2TYQRfNSIoYuj2cV)
