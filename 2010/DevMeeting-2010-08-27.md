    * classbox
    * traits
    * keyword arguments
    * compatibility?
    * -&gt; matz: 100% compatible
      * crap
  * yugui: 1.9 should include 2.0 features, gradually
  * yugui: 1.9 branch should not be made
  * mame: can make compatible 1.9 release?
  * acceptable if well documented
  * if we have a compatibility issue on 1.9 and 2.0 development, then create 1.9 branch
* Ruby 1.8.* release plan (by syouhei)
  * knu: ruby 1.8.8 will be release in this year.
  * knu: ruby 1.8.8 will be last release of 1.8 series.
  * knu: if there are serious issue with 1.9 series, we will release 1.8.9.
  * akr: Should 1.8.8 include 1.9.2 methods which 1.9.1 doesn't have?
  * knu: We can ignore 1.9.1.
  * knu: NEWS document is really important.
  * akr: How to maintain NEWS file? -&gt; flush
* The license of Ruby (by naruse)
  * naruse: GPL3 incompatible. OK: BSD -&gt; Ruby, NG: Ruby -&gt; BSD
  * naruse: How about to change license Ruby's and BSD?
  * ..some lawyers discussion...
  * matz: i'm thinking to change only GPL2 or later.  However, not enough consideration.  plus BSD seems OK.  We need more law knowledge.
  * how about triple license? (BSD, GPL2 or later, Ruby's)
  * triple doesn't have any merits.
  * BSD + Ruby's?
  * matz: if no objection, changing license is ok. I wait  objections for 2 weeks.
  * akr: we can't change part of ruby source code (such as win32.c).
* Windows support in the future (by usa)
  * usa: how about to stop win32 support? (ADDED: usa is a Windows platform mgr, who is 'Usaku Nakamura')
  * nahi: On Windows, JRuby is better than CRuby. (ADDED: nahi is one of a JRuby commiter, who is 'Hiroshi Nakamura', not usa)
  * ... rubyspec discussion ...
  * usa: only mswin32. not cygwin/mingw.
  * usa: any other maintainers?
  * aaron: luis and roger?
  * usa: good.
  * matz: how about to search next maintainer before 1.9.3 release?
  * usa: agreed.
  * maintain mswin64?
  * usa: absolutely.  win64 is interesting.
* Ruby continuous integration (by tenderlove)
  * arron: Should have standard CI?
  * akr: before making such great system, we should make tests green
  * nahi: Can chkbuild split tests into small part?
  * akr: Please use your favorite tool.
  * ...
