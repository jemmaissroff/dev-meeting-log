# DevMeeting-2017-07-14

Date: 2017/07/14 (Fri)
Time: 14:00- 18:00 (JST)
Place: Cookpad, Inc.
Sign-up: https://ruby.connpass.com/event/60055/
Attendees:
Language: mostly Japanese (sorry for non native Japanese speakers)

Please add your favorite ticket numbers you want to ask to discuss.

* NOTE
  * Dev meeting *IS NOT* a decision making place. All decisions should be done at the bug tracker.
  * Dev meeting is a place we can ask Matz, nobu, nurse and other developers directly. Matz is a very busy person.  Take this opportunity to ask him. If you can not attend, other attendees can ask instead of you (if attendees can understand your issue).
  * We will write a log about discussion to a file or to each ticket in English.
  * All activities are best-effort (keep in mind that most of us are volunteer developers).
  * The date, time and place is scheduled according to when/where we can reserve Matz's time.

# Agenda

* NOTE: Write at least "ticket number/title/link" and your name (see example below). Explain details on the ticket. If you cannot attend the meeting, we appreciate a short summary because we can understand it more easily (long discussion is difficult to read, especially in a non-native language). Your motivation is also welcome.

## About 2.5 timeframe

## Write your name and your interest (what do you want to ask and to whom?) please.

- ## \[Feature [#13666](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13666&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087205352871&usg=AOvVaw3Po-o362aVMKWIvFedFf0O)\] Allow to write specs instead of tests (nobody wants to write test code twice). (eregon)


- Martin: Okay to me.
- nobu: nobody disallows to write specs at the first place, do they?

- ## \[Feature [#13665](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13665&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087205353342&usg=AOvVaw2wUqCkIJVzi2pQ2d0sIUHQ)\] Before I added String#delete\_prefix. For symmetry, is it okay to commit String#delete\_suffix? (sonots)


- shyouhei: should we add it?
- matz: no objection.

- ## \[Feature [#13743](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13743&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087205353899&usg=AOvVaw2f33NXuymDNo2g9nlJCe7g)\] Support linking of files opened with O\_TMPFILE (mmasaki)


- nobu: File.link or File#link?
- akr: what about support linkat(2) instead of a Linux-specific code in core?
- matz: I think the proposed API is the simplest.  However platform specific.
- Martin: what about making it as a gem?
- akr: linkat(2) is at POSIX since 2008.
- matz: reject this particular proposal.  Think linkat(2) request when such thing requested separatedly.
