# DevMeeting-2017-06-16

Date: 2017/06/16 (Fri)
Time: 14:00- 18:00 (JST)
Place: Money Forward inc. Headquarter
Sign-up: https://ruby.connpass.com/event/57968/
Attendees: duerst (Martin Dürst)
Language: mostly Japanese (sorry for non native Japanese speakers)

Please add your favorite ticket numbers you want to ask to discuss.

* NOTE
  * Dev meeting *IS NOT* a decision making place. All decisions should be done at the bug tracker.
  * Dev meeting is a place we can ask Matz, nobu, nurse and other developers directly. Matz is a very busy person.  Take this opportunity to ask him. If you can not attend, other attendees can ask instead of you (if attendees can understand your issue).
  * We will write a log about discussion to a file or to each ticket in English.
  * All activities are best-effort (keep in mind that most of us are volunteer developers).
  * The date, time and place is scheduled according to when/where we can reserve Matz's time.

# Agenda

* NOTE: Write at least "ticket number/title/link" and your name (see example below). Explain details on the ticket. If you cannot attend the meeting, we appreciate a short summary because we can understand it more easily (long discussion is difficult to read, especially in a non-native language). Your motivation is also welcome.

## About 2.5 timeframe

* https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-trunk/wiki/ReleaseEngineering25

  * (sonots) I implemented with a name `String#remove_prefix`. If the name is ok, I want to merge it. Matz, could you decide? There were other candidates such as lchomp, trim_prefix. I dropped trim_prefix because trim is used to remove a list of characters rather than a substring in some languages, so I felt trim_prefix would raise confusion. I dropped lchomp because I just had never heard.

- hsbt: rubygems/rubygems 2.7 requires bundler.  After it is released, when ruby-core merges that version, we have to take care.

- import bundler for test then?
- if so why only for test?

- ko1: is there any blocker?
- hsbt: rspec.

- ## \[Feature [#13332](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13332&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087184889733&usg=AOvVaw1CcdqiB6YdbxIhbWJbFX_1)\] Forwardable#def\_instance\_delegator nil (shyouhei)

- ko1: we need more use cases.
- martin: nobu: add them to the ticket.

- ## \[Feature [#13378](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13378&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087184890861&usg=AOvVaw01R3vn2nSGuEbMj6mswm8d)\] Eliminate 4 of 8 syscalls when requiring file by absolute path (shyouhei)


- nobu: I don’t want to handle fds this way because we can’t close properly on exceptions. I think we should wrap them using IOs.

- ## \[Feature [#13381](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13381&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087184891306&usg=AOvVaw2zjJLQ9Mw0cLcrODpULDzV)\] \[PATCH\] Expose rb\_fstring and its family to C extensions (shyouhei)


- ko1: how about it? I don’t like “f”string naming.
- nobu: other languages call it “intern”
- ko1: true but we already have rb\_intern().
- ko1: nobody has idea. so that nobu and ko1 will decide it. nobody against exposing this functionality.

- ## \[Feature [#13385](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13385&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087184891916&usg=AOvVaw2RVOIyAr1VhU4Gt8NHdOS7)\] \[PATCH\] Make Resolv::DNS::Name validation similar to host and dig commands (shyouhei)


- akr: I can’t say if this is valid until I fully understand the RFC.
- akira: what about using domain\_name gem?
- assign akr.

- ## \[Feature [#13383](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13383&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087184892450&usg=AOvVaw1EEHWUhq4dhMc6OymCu0aP)\] \[PATCH\] Module#source\_location (shyouhei)


- akira: needs?
- shyouhei: I think source\_locations makes more sense than source\_location.
- akira: I started to confuse.  Is it useful?  We can already get Method#source\_location.

- ## \[Feature [#12063](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12063&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087184893030&usg=AOvVaw2Fo_FzZrLeD7RWEGzoofyN)\] KeyError#receiver and KeyError#name (shyouhei) status?


- matz: I take KeyError#key.

- ## \[Bug [#13397](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13397&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087184893580&usg=AOvVaw3zo4Xb1qFIH5rUZyPSr234)\] #object\_id should not be signed (shyouhei)


- akr: isn’t it possible to somehow calculate so that we can avoid negative object\_id?  Because pointers are 8 byte aligned, while positive fixnums are of 262 space.
- nobu: it’s true we can avoid negative numbers on some environment, but not always.
- reject this specific issue and request for new issue that address the inspect helper.

- ## \[Feature [#13396](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13396&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087184894240&usg=AOvVaw1vefgo5p62kDz6Zt2V-Onx)\] Net::HTTP has no write timeout (shyouhei)

- ## \[Feature [#13618](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13618&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087184910659&usg=AOvVaw1G8dM5_WXvz1jRn3bJCqOH)\] \[PATCH\] auto fiber schedule for rb\_wait\_for\_single\_fd and rb\_waitpid (normalperson)


- ko1: programmers transfer execution of fibers by hand.  Eric proposes to introduce “auto”-Fiber which are OK to transfer each other on blocking situations. His implementation is great. rb\_wait\_for\_single\_fd is the ponit of switching. matz wanted this feature, too.
- shyouhei: can auto Fibers be a subject to transfer or an object?
- ko1: transfer happens only from an auto fiber to another and nothing else, AFAIK.
- ko1: This is essentially a re-introduction of Ruby 1.8 threads (without time-tick). I’m concerning about thread difficulties like locking.
- akr: is locking OK for auto Fibers?
- ko1: Fibers has not needed locking because so far, Fiber.yield has been the only mechanism to transfer execution so it was very explicit.  auto-Fiber changes that so there can be unintended transfers.
- matz: do you want to reject this?
- ko1: I don’t want to accept until we introduce a way to explicitly state where we can transfer, like async/await.
- ko1: I think it’s NG to call routines that are not Fiber-aware from proposed  auto-Fiber.  I don’t think people can insert appropriate Thread.exclusive calls because if they could, we could never have experienced resource contentions.
- matz: I think it’s hard to tag every and all of fiber-aware routines to be async.  That sounds too big.
- matz: show us your counter-proposal.
- ko1: is it OK for you to accept Eric’s proposal as-is?
- matz: I’m positive, but I know your concern so I won’t accept right now.

- ## (sonots) I implemented with a name String#remove\_prefix. If the name is ok, I want to merge it. Matz, could you decide? There were other candidates such as lchomp, trim\_prefix. I dropped trim\_prefix because trim is used to remove a list of characters rather than a substring in some languages, so I felt trim\_prefix would raise confusion. I dropped lchomp because I just had never heard.

- ## candidates discussed:


- lchomp
- chompl
- guilotine
- ltrim / rtrim

- NG because PHP behaves differently

- delete\_prefix

- amatsuda: remove\_prefix sounds strange if it doesn’t change the receiver.
- nobu: facets has lchomp.
- akr: I don’t want chomp’s complex newline handling for this requested method.
- ko1: remove\_prefix seems has no downsides.
- matz: accept delete\_prefix.
