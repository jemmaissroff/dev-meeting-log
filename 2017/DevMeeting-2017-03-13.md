# DevMeeting-2017-03-13

Date: 2017/03/13 (Wed)
Time: 14:00- 19:00 (JST)
Place: Money Forward inc. Headquarter
Sign-up: https://ruby.connpass.com/event/51783/
Attendees: Yukihiro Matsumoto (matz), Koichi Sasada, Nobuyoshi Nakada, Yui Naruse, Shyouhei Urabe, Akira Tanaka, Hiroshi Shibata, Masaya Tarui, Martin Dürst (duerst)
Language: mostly Japanese (sorry for non native Japanese speakers)

Please add your favorite ticket numbers you want to ask to discuss.

* NOTE
  * Dev meeting *IS NOT* a decision making place. All decisions should be done at the bug tracker.
  * Dev meeting is a place we can ask Matz, nobu, nurse and other developers directly. Matz is a very busy person.  Take this opportunity to ask him. If you can not attend, other attendees can ask instead of you (if attendees can understand your issue).
  * We will write a log about discussion to a file or to each ticket in English.
  * All activities are best-effort (keep in mind that most of us are volunteer developers).
  * The date, time and place is scheduled according to when/where we can reserve Matz's time.

# Agenda

* NOTE: Write at least "ticket number/title/link" and your name (see example below). Explain details on the ticket. If you cannot attend the meeting, we appreciate a short summary because we can understand it more easily (long discussion is difficult to read, especially in a non-native language). Your motivation is also welcome.

## Carry-over from previous meeting(s)

- \[Feature [#13110](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13110&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087099215238&usg=AOvVaw0xN5gKnOxOoMJuPSR-6tHp)\] Byte-based operations for String (shugo)

- matz: OK for byteoffset.
- akr: destructive modification using bytesplice may cause string rescan because it can break validity of the string.
- duerst: is byteindex needed? is it enough to add a method for MatchData?
- naruse: that is byteoffset here.
- akr: byteindex may have problem for inter-codepoint index.

- \[Bug [#13105](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13105&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087099215908&usg=AOvVaw0O3GiFFJWC56gM1ogTVdTU)\] String#to\_f and String#to\_r don't stop successive underscores (nobu)

- nobu: is this intentional?
- ko1: ignore all underscores?
- shyouhei: all? at the beginning?
- ko1: \_ generates zero for to\_i.
- akr: to\_i once allowed multiple underscores but prohibits now.
- tal: ruby’s parser does not allow multiple undersocres as literals.
- matz: these days other languages follow us like java, python.

- python: PEP-515, no multiple undersocres
- java: no pre-post undersocres, but multiple inter-underscores allowed.

- matz: OK, lets make it as we do as literals.

- \[Feature [#13109](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13109&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087099216861&usg=AOvVaw0erPIxct6YD7y0abLysVr_)\] using in refinements is required to be physically placed before the refined method call (shyouhei)

- matz: I don’t think it’s a bug. It’s intentional.  But we may allow this as an extension.

- \[Bug [#12705](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12705&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087099217332&usg=AOvVaw1qMyEnb2Nd3sHYLjJBe1IP)\] yielding args to a lambda uses block/proc rather than lambda/method semantics (shyouhei) status?

- ko1: we should fix the interpreter
- ko1: we introduced ad-hoc change to lambda creation but that turned out to be a mistake, and observed here.
- ko1: to be fixed in 2.5.

- \[Feature [#13095](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13095&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087099217859&usg=AOvVaw066oj3PgFXySVobuckLeqT)\] \[PATCH\] io.c (rb\_f\_syscall): remove deprecation notice (shyouhei)

- shyouhei: do we want to remove system calls?
- akr: yes.
- ko1: it is about foreign-function interface
- akr: syscall could be easier than libffi because syscall has only one entry point.
- matz: I think it’s safer to avoid using this feature so kind of reject in mood but …
- akr: current situation is too difficult to use properly, too easy to get used.
- akr: my suggestion is to move it to ext/syscall.

- \[Feature [#13122](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13122&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087099218630&usg=AOvVaw1SRRvSfqN5fhvIzq0wOpNs)\] Special syntax for Hash#default\_proc (shyouhei)

- tal: not only default proc, but also there are default values.
- matz: reject

- \[Feature [#12650](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12650&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087099219093&usg=AOvVaw3JpLnOerj1nUKGqvRnIddj)\] Use UTF-8 encoding for ENV on Windows (duerst)

- nobu: ENV is about inter-process, we cannot change alone.
- shyouhei: seems they need something like “UTF-8 mode”
- nobu: that should be “-U”
- shyouhei: does that option change the encoding of ENV?
- naruse: it might be possible to use default internal.
- akr: is ENV in windows handled by kernel?
- nobu: yes
- akr: then what encoding?
- nobu: so-called wide character.
- duerst: when a PC is used by only one person ENV tends to remain single encoding but when people share a PC, ENV is shared across users. (cp437?)
- nobu: system-wide.

- \[Feature [#6284](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/6284&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087099220048&usg=AOvVaw3Gp66fHVpk497QngalvDcR)\] Add composition for procs (shyouhei)

- ko1: is it a matter of speed?
- shyouhei: it seems composition is faster now
- nobu: notation seems also be the problem.
- duerst: notation is a point. (f ∘ g)(x) can be either f(g(x)) or g(f(x)).
- matz: I have no strong opinion on it.
- matz: I’ll respond.

- \[Feature [#13137](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13137&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087099220749&usg=AOvVaw2tyFZZiP8em3CshXFSwAhR)\] Hash Shorthand (shyouhei)

- matz: reject

- \[Feature [#13166](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13166&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087099221148&usg=AOvVaw3p_MXSXFgsq6Tez2JmQmdh)\] Feature Request: Byte Arrays for Ruby 3 (shyouhei)

- akr: I’m for this but I don’t think I can persuade matz.
- matz: exactly.
- akr: so I proposed setbit/getbit, in order for the OP to create a dedicated class on top of it.

- \[Feature [#9116](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/9116&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087099221706&usg=AOvVaw3aDTz3pGyxRcgoODBkm5S5)\] String#rsplit missing (shyouhei)

- akr: what’s this?
- shyouhei: they say python’s
- naruse: use case?
- tal: rsplit(...,2) can be generally written using regexp. ohter cases when we cant do this using regexp?

- \[Feature [#4532](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/4532&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087099222269&usg=AOvVaw22AvqSOLdUchLTL9e7lFeZ)\] \[PATCH\] add IO#pread and IO#pwrite methods (shyouhei)

- akr: portability concern? This is POSIX but added recently.
- shyouhei: POSIX issue 5
- akr: at least 2001 version has this.
- matz: OK.

- \[Bug [#13146](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13146&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087099222840&usg=AOvVaw3WNO4EjCXfize9UXRWvo6g)\] Float::NANs in Hashes are confusing (more than usual). (mrkn)

- nobu: prohibit inserting NaNs into hashs?
- naruse: that’s nonsense.

- \[Bug [#13134](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13134&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087099223330&usg=AOvVaw2yJhRMDxlA9rZvFUhUd4T2)\] Rational() inconsistency (nobu)

- matz: OK.

## From attendees

- \[Bug #13304\] public function rb\_thread\_fd\_close is removed at r57422 (naruse)

- naruse: there are usages for this function.
- akr: why do you want to remove this?
- nobu: this is not a function to close a fd (bad naming). rb\_io\_close shall be used instead.
- ko1: then why not just let it an alias of rb\_io\_close?
- nobu: shuld we deprecate?
- naruse: no. you can’t deprecate without transition path.
- conclusion: delete DEPRECATE

- \[Feature #12926\] -l flag for line end processing should use chomp! instead of chop! (naruse)

- nobu: this one predates 1.0. should we backport?
- matz: I don’t think so.

- \[Bug [#13284](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13284&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087099226976&usg=AOvVaw2_Lcw6Gi_iZL6aqA2Zzlhx)\] IA64 ruby 2.4 miniruby segfault

## From non-attendees

- \[Bug [#13223](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13223&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1686087099232038&usg=AOvVaw1rr2yUj5QHpJ9FbbtUdbmo)\] What should the behavior of File.join be when File::SEPARATOR is set? Can I apply this patch? (tenderlove)

- ko1: this is a bug.
- nobu: this is either we fix the document to allow other separators or not.
- akr: I’d like to refrain from adding new feature.
- nobu: File.split does not honor the constant.
- shyouhei: It seems jruby honors this constant.
- matz: OK, lets not use File::SEPARATOR, and explicitly state in document that we might ignore reassignments to that constant.
