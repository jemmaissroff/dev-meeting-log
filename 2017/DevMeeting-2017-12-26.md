# DevMeeting-2017-12-26

Date: 2017/12/26 (Tue)
Time: 14:00- 18:00 (JST)
Place: Speee Inc.
Sign-up: https://ruby.connpass.com/event/74486/
log edit: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N9zFqYKPTFBu7VYxp32qT2vRqbLPLi2GnDDzgEmnxDA/edit
Attendees: (add your name here if you would like to participate) Kenta Murata, Yusuke Endoh
Regrets: (add your name here if you often attend, but can't attend this time)
Language: mostly Japanese (sorry for non native Japanese speakers)

Please add your favorite ticket numbers you want to ask to discuss.

* NOTE
  * Dev meeting *IS NOT* a decision making place. All decisions should be done at the bug tracker.
  * Dev meeting is a place we can ask Matz, nobu, nurse and other developers directly. Matz is a very busy person.  Take this opportunity to ask him. If you can not attend, other attendees can ask instead of you (if attendees can understand your issue).
  * We will write a log about discussion to a file or to each ticket in English.
  * All activities are best-effort (keep in mind that most of us are volunteer developers).
  * The date, time and place is scheduled according to when/where we can reserve Matz's time.

# Agenda

* NOTE: Write at least "ticket number/title/link" and your name (see example below). Explain details on the ticket. If you cannot attend the meeting, we appreciate a short summary because we can understand it more easily (long discussion is difficult to read, especially in a non-native language). Your motivation is also welcome.

Agenda
About 2.6 timeframe
From matz
About concurrency
Ko1: The name of “Thriber” is should be “Thread”. It shouldn’t include the essence of “Fiber”. Because it is automatically switching its contexts.
Mame: “Fiber”’ is manually context switching, not automatically.
Matz: Node’s coroutine is automatic context switching.

From attendees
Obsolete $SAFE from Ruby 2.6? (ko1) [Feature #5455]
$SAFE will be thread-local, instead of proc-local.
